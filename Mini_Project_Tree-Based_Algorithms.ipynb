    " As we have learned in the previous lectures, Decision Trees as a family of algorithms (irrespective to the particular implementation) are powerful algorithms that can produce models with a predictive accuracy higher than that produced by linear models, such as Linear or Logistic Regression. Primarily, this is due to the fact the DT's can model nonlinear relationships, and also have a number of tuning paramters, that allow for the practicioner to achieve the best possible model. An added bonus is the ability to visualize the trained Decision Tree model, which allows for some insight into how the model has produced the predictions that it has. One caveat here, to keep in mind, is that sometimes, due to the size of the dataset (both in the sense of the number of records, as well as the number of features), the visualization might prove to be very large and complex, increasing the difficulty of interpretation."

We strongly encourage you to use it here as well, not just because it's standard practice, but also becuase it's not going to be computationally to intensive, due to the size of the dataset that you're working with. Our suggestion here is that you split the data into 70% training, and 30% testing. Then, do the hyperparameter tuning and Cross Validation on the training set, and afterwards to a final test on the testing set.)"

    "A final method for gaining some insight into the inner working of your Random Forests models is a so-called Partial Dependence Plot. The Partial Dependence Plot (PDP or PD plot) shows the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted outcome of a previously fit model. The prediction function is fixed at a few values of the chosen features and averaged over the other features. A partial dependence plot can show if the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. \n",
